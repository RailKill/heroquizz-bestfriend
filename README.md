**Get a full score on HeroQuizz "how well do you know me?" questions.**
This quiz is trending on Facebook (last checked: 25th March 2016). Time to show that you're everyone's best friend! I wrote this in about 10 minutes, it's not optimal but it works. RailKill is awesome, tell that to me... please!

# What does it do?
It will click on all the correct answers of this quiz, one by one until it's finished.

# How to use?
1. Go to your friend's "how well do you know me" quiz, and start it.
2. Run either of these scripts. For example in Chrome, open the Console (Ctrl + Shift + J), then copy the contents of the script and paste it there, press Enter:
  - **heroquizz_fullscore.js:** Automatically answers all questions in about a minute. You can do something else in the mean time.
  - **heroquizz_psychic.js:** Highlights all correct answers for you, but you have to answer it yourself.

# Modifications
- Change the TIME variable to modify the delay between answering questions. For me, 3000 milliseconds is required so that there are no problems.
